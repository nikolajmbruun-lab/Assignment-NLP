  "limitations": "\n1. TOPIC EXTRACTION:\n   - Strengths: LLM generally identifies main policy areas (climate, economy, migration)\n   - Weaknesses: Sometimes too general (e.g., \"EU policy\" instead of specific policy)\n   - Systematic errors: May miss nuanced sub-topics or conflate related topics\n\n2. ENTITY EXTRACTION:\n   - Strengths: Good at identifying major institutions (Commission, Parliament, Council)\n   - Weaknesses: Inconsistent with person names (sometimes extracts, sometimes doesn't)\n   - Systematic errors: May include generic terms like \"member states\" as entities\n\n3. SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION:\n   - Strengths: Captures general tone (supportive vs. critical)\n   - Weaknesses: Struggles with mixed sentiment or sarcasm\n   - Systematic errors: Tends toward \"neutral\" when uncertain\n\n4. SUMMARY QUALITY:\n   - Strengths: Captures main point of speech\n   - Weaknesses: May lose important details or context\n   - Systematic errors: Sometimes too brief or too verbose\n\n5. OVERALL EXTRACTION QUALITY:\n   - Estimated Precision: ~85-90% (most extractions are reasonable)\n   - Estimated Recall: ~70-75% (some information is missed)\n   - Main issue: Inconsistency across different speech types and lengths\n\n6. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:\n   - Use more specific prompts for entity types\n   - Add examples to the prompt (few-shot learning)\n   - Post-process to normalize entity names\n   - Implement confidence scores for extractions\n   - Use larger model for better nuance detection\n"
